GenAI Music with second-by-second control

I want to use GenAI to inspire and engage musicians, not rip them off!
(I say this and then can't find anything that suits my needs and I'm tempted to just
bootstrap off of the Suno API. Oh how quickly my morals crumble, but I'm
willing to negotiate a lot when it comes to producing a banger XD )

If you'd like to contribute to this project, I'm always happy to take PRs!
