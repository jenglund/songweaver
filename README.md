A way to organize, tag, search, edit, and explore your generated tracks!

I love making music with Suno (especially using my "Songburst" method), but OMG the platform is SO PAINFUL for organizing!
1. Playlists on mobile only go to 50 tracks? WTF?
2. Can't easily view all my playlists on mobile, sometimes also not on web. Losing an entire playlist because it's "too old to show up" (or in a weird place such that it doesn't ever show up) makes the whole Playlist system worthless!
3. I've generated 20000+ tracks in a year. There is NO WAY I can pull up all the tracks I haven't even reviewed yet in Suno, no way to find everything I haven't even played yet. What good is all that credit I'm spending if I can't even find my results?
4. The editor is way too much and too clunky and I don't need to make all these "clips" of seeds in advance, I just want to be able to highlight parts of a track I like and, on demand, generate the clips if I want to plug them back into Suno to generate more stuff with.

Enter, Songweaver! 

Built to work with my Songburst workflow (check my Bsky), all you have to do is generate your tracks in Suno, upload each track's URL and MP3 to Songweaver (yes this sucks but Suno's ToS hypocritically prohibits using automation with it), and then explore all your music in Songweaver; the only time you have to go back to Suno is to download the WAVs of the things you wanna take forward into production off-platform!
